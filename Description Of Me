Hi there! 

Welcome to my Github. I am Ethan Rothstein - a passionate coder and tech enthusiast. I am currently going into my junior year 
at the University of Iowa. Throughout my account, I'm currently trying to dive deeper into SQL and working on improving my 
coding. On this platform, I aim to showcase my coding projects and other stuff that I have built on my freetime. Each project 
I created is stuff that I am interested in and wanted a deeper understanding of.  I'm always open to feedback and collaboration, 
so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or have suggestions for my projects!
