Hi there! Welcome to my Github. I am Ethan Rothstein - a passionate coder and tech enthusiast. I'm currently diving deeper into SQL and working on improving my coding. On this platform, I aim to showcase my coding projects and other stuff that I have built on my freetime. Each project I created is stuff that I am interested in and wanted a deeper understanding of. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or have suggestions for my projects!
